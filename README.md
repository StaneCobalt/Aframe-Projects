# Aframe-Projects
This is just a repo to use while I'm learning A-Frame. Nothing too fancy, but if you're also learning you could take a look through here and maybe find some help.

Purpose of each test:
Hello World: Get A-Frame to do something.
Test 1: How to make objects play animations.
Test 2: How to make a different object do something when I interact with another object, and how to display text.
Test 3: Rendering a scene that feels natural.

Basically, I'm learning A-Frame so I can make a virtual tour for my office. You can view the test projects by clicking the link below.
