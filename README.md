# Aframe-Projects
This is just a repo to use while I'm learning A-Frame. Nothing too fancy, but if you're also learning you could take a look through here and maybe find some help.

Purpose of each test:
- Hello World: Get A-Frame to do something.
- Test 1: How to make objects play animations.
- Test 2: How to make a different object do something when I interact with another object, and how to display text.
- Test 3: Rendering a scene that feels natural. In this case, an office environment.
- Test 4: Trying out lights and 3D textures.
- Test 5: Viewing a 360 photo taken with my 360fly camera.
- Test 6: Working with selective intersection and gaze based interaction.
- Test 7: Trying to figure how to get a light attached to the camera to rotate with it
